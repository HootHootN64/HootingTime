How can I play it?
  - You need a backup of your ‘Mario Kart 64 (U) [!].z64′ ROM
  - Then apply the patch to it using a .bps patcher (beat, flips …) 
    or use an online tool (https://patch.wedarobi.com/hootingtime)
  - Open it in an Emulator like Project 64
  - Have a hooting time!

# EMULATOR #
############

Why does it not work on Emulator?
  - Don't use old Emulator versions. I recommend Project 64 3.0.1. 
  - Enable 8mb memory
  - Disable debugger & interpreter core for max performance
  
Why are custom characters translucent?
  - Change your video plugin. I recommend the Project 64 video plugin.

# CONSOLE #

Why does Hooting Time 1.0 crash all the time?
  - It's not fully compatible with console due to faulty floating point operations with the sound code there
