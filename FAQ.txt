# EMULATOR #
############

Why does it not work on Emulator?
  - Don't use old Emulator versions. I recommend Project 64 3.0.1. 
  - Enable 8mb memory
  - Disable debugger & interpreter core for max performance
  
Why are custom characters translucent?
  - Change your video plugin. I recommend the Project 64 video plugin.

Why does Hooting Time 1.0 crash all the time?
  - It's not fully compatible with console due to faulty floating point operations with the sound code there
