How can I play it?
  - You need a backup of your ‘Mario Kart 64 (U) [!].z64′ ROM
  - Then apply the patch to it using a .bps patcher (beat, flips …) 
    or use an online tool (https://patch.wedarobi.com/hootingtime)
  - Open it in an Emulator like Project 64 / play it from your EverDrive cartridge on console
  - Have a Hooting Time!

The game crashed with an error, what should I do?
  - Please check GitHub issues if it's a known error, otherwise open an issue or DM me with specifics

# EMULATOR ERRORS #
###################

Why does it not work on Emulator?
  - Don't use old Emulator versions. I recommend Project 64 3.0.1 or 4.0
  - Enable 8mb memory
  - Disable debugger & interpreter core for max performance
  
Why are custom characters translucent?
  - Change your video plugin. I recommend the Project 64 video plugin. (Heard that Glide works with PJ64 4.0)

Why are the numbers 2 and 5 changed up in the HUD time and rank?
  - That's a strange behavior some video plugins show for whatever reason

# CONSOLE ERRORS #
##################

What's the error in the address arange around 800c4a64 in Hooting Time 1.1?
  - Still an audio related issue. You could try to set the audio to 'Mono' in-game to mitigate it

Why does Hooting Time 1.0 crash all the time?
  - It's not fully compatible with console due to faulty floating point operations within the sound code there
