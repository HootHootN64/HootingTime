How can I play it?
  - You need a backup of your ‘Mario Kart 64 (U) [!].z64′ ROM
  - Then apply the patch to it using a .bps patcher (beat, flips …) 
    or use an online tool (https://patch.wedarobi.com/hootingtime)
  - Open it in an Emulator like Project 64 / play it from your EverDrive cartridge on console
  - Have a Hooting Time!

# ERRORS #
##########

The game crashed with an error, what should I do?
  - Please check GitHub issues if it's a known error, otherwise open one or contact me (Discord) with specifics

    ##################
    # GENERAL ERRORS #
    ##################

    Why is the HUD (itemview, speedometer etc.) all over the place?
      - You didn't complete the HUD setup screen at first start correctly
      - Go to: Pause>Settings>HUD+Screen and press A while having selected 'screen setup' to try again (or delete your save file)

    # EMULATOR ERRORS #
    ###################

    Why does it not work on Emulator?
      - Don't use old Emulator versions. I recommend Project 64 3.0.1 or 4.0
      - Enable 8mb memory
      - Disable debugger & interpreter core for max performance

    Why are custom characters translucent?
      - Change your video plugin. I recommend the Project 64 video plugin. (Heard that Glide works with PJ64 4.0)

    Why is the game super fast in multiplayer?
      - The emulator (e.g. Retroarch/PJ64 4.0) got auto recognized as console. Use Settings -> Performance -> !!!System override: Emulator

    Why are the numbers 2 and 5 changed up in the HUD time and rank?
      - That's a strange behavior some video plugins show for whatever reason

    # CONSOLE ERRORS #
    ##################

    Why does Hooting Time 1.0 crash all the time?
      - It's not fully compatible with console due to faulty floating point operations within the sound code there. Use 1.1 instead.
